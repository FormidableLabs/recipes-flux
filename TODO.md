TODO

* File names `lower-dashed-case.js`, `lower-dashed-case.css`
* Grep on Epicure and maybe replace name?
* Come up with "real" SASS build / dev / watch / etc.
* Add livereload.
* Add corresponding SASS tasks like `build-css:dev`, `build-css:prod`.
* May want to split existing JS to `build-js:dev` and `build-js:prod`.
