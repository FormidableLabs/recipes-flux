Refrigerate. \n Meanwhile, saute onion, pepper and garlic clove in oil until tender. Crush garlic with a fork. Then add Tomatoes, parsley, basil, and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and simmer, stirring often, for 15 minutes, breaking up tomatoes as you stir. \n When polenta is chilled, slice it in 1/2 rounds. Do the same with the eggplants. Oil a 9 x 13 inch baking dish and overlap alternating slices of eggplant and polenta in a pretty, fish scale design. Or, if the eggplant is too big, layer it lasagna style. Pour tomato sauce over the whole works and sprinkle cheese on top. Cover the dish and bake in a 350°F oven for 45 minutes, or until eggplant tests done with a fork."
